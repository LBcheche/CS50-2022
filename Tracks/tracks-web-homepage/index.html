            <h1> Design Patterns </h1>
            <p  class="text-justify">
            Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.
            </p>
            <p  class="text-justify">
            You canâ€™t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.
            </p>
            <p  class="text-justify">
            Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.
            </p>
            <p  class="text-justify">
            An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.
            </p>

            <h2> Benefits of Patterns </h2>
            <p  class="text-justify">
               Patterns are a toolkit of solutions to common problems in software design. They define a common language that helps your team communicate more efficiently.
            </p>

            <h2> Classification </h2>
            <p  class="text-justify">
            Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed. I like the analogy to road construction: you can make an intersection safer by either installing some traffic lights or building an entire multi-level interchange with underground passages for pedestrians.
            </p>
            <p  class="text-justify">
            The most basic and low-level patterns are often called idioms. They usually apply only to a single programming language.
            </p>
            <p  class="text-justify">
            The most universal and high-level patterns are architectural patterns. Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.
            </p>
            <p  class="text-justify">
            In addition, all patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose. This book covers three main groups of patterns:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li class="text-justify"><strong>Creational patterns</strong> provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.</li>

            <li class="text-justify"><strong>Structural patterns </strong>explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.</li>

            <li class="text-justify"><strong>Behavioral patterns </strong>take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.</li>
            </ul>
